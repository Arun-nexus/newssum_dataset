Addressing an event at the Rajiv Gandhi Health University in Bengaluru via video conference, Modi said, “The virus may be an invisible enemy. But our warriors, medical workers are invincible. In the battle of Invisible vs Invincible, our medical workers are sure to win.” He also said that the world is looking at them with gratitude, hope, and seeks both ‘care’ and ‘cure’.\\n\\n“At the root of India’s brave fight against COVID-19 is the hard work of the medical community and our corona warriors. In fact, doctors and medical workers are like soldiers, but without the soldiers’ uniforms,” he added.\\nDuring the address, PM Modi also stressed that violence against COVID warriors will not be tolerated. “I want to state it clearly- violence, abuse and rude behaviour against front-line workers is not acceptable,” he said, during the inauguration of silver jubilee celebrations of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences.', 'output': 'Prime Minister of India said that the Virus may be an Invisible enemy. but our warriors, medical workers are invincible.
